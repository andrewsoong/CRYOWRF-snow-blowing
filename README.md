## Description

CRYOWRF is a coupled atmosphere-snow cover model with WRF (v4.2.1) acting as the atmospheric core and SNOWPACK acting as snow cover model. SNOWPACK is an option to be used as land-surface scheme within WRF and interacts with WRF via the specially developed coupler.

In the process of coupling, significant changes had to be made to both WRF. See the [here](changelog_WRF.md) for the changelog for WRF modifications.
Additionally, some edits were made to the WPS programs as well. A list of those edits can be found [here](changelog_WPS.md)

For installation instructions read [this](INSTALL.md)
