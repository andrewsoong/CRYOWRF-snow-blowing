# CRYOWRF v1.0

## Description

CRYOWRF is a coupled atmosphere-snow cover model with WRF (v4.2.1) acting as the atmospheric core and SNOWPACK acting as snow cover model. SNOWPACK is an option to be used as land-surface scheme within WRF and interacts with WRF via the specially developed coupler. 

In the process of coupling, significant changes had to be made to both WRF. See the [here](changelog_WRF.md) for the changelog for WRF modifications. Additionally, some edits were made to the WPS programs as well. A list of those edits can be found [here](changelog_WPS.md)

## Developed by

CRYOWRF is developed by members of the Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences (CRYOS), ENAC, EPFL, Lausanne

and 

the Snow processes group, Snow and Atmosphere Research Unit, SLF Davos.
